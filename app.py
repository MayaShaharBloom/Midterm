    Findings from T-Test: Behavioral Differences in Class 5 Users.  
    
    To understand what distinguishes heavy users (Class 5) from the rest of the population, I conducted independent t-tests on key behavioral metrics. The results show statistically significant differences across all variables except age.

    - App Usage Time: Class 5 users spend over twice as much time on apps compared to others.
    - Screen On Time: Their screens are active for more than 10 hours per day, suggesting high engagement or phone dependence.
    - Battery Drain: Significantly higher battery usage reflects constant device activity across functions.
    - Data Usage: Nearly triple the data consumption indicates more online activity (streaming, browsing, social media).
    - Number of Apps Installed: Class 5 users have over twice the number of apps, pointing to broader and more frequent app exploration.

    The model revealed a strong and significant relationship: 

    - Each additional app increases screen-on time by approximately 6.5 minutes/day
    - The regression line fits the data closely with RÂ² = 0.897
    - The result is also visually confirmed by the strong linear trend and tight confidence interval around the red regression line

    These findings suggest that the number of apps installed is not just a passive metric â€” it actively contributes to increased phone engagement. This supports our hypothesis that app diversity drives screen dependence, a key indicator of potential overuse.
